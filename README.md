# Project Title

EDA and Report of Crime Rate Vancouver 2003-2017

### Intro

Vancouver has been named one of the most liveable city in the world for many years. One of the reasons why Vancouver is a highly desirable place to live is probably low local crime rates. However, the overall crime rate in Vancouver is higher than the national average by 26%, and this has become a major concern of Vancouver city council. Although the government of the city of Vancouver are spending millions of dollars, high crime rates in some areas such as Downtown Eastside or Main Street region are still not under control. what makes the crime rate of Vancouver higher than the other Canadian cities? Where should the government budget and resources be spent on to lower the crime rate? In this report, I am introducing major findings and solutions from my analytic studies on crime rate of Vancouver in an effort to answer these questions.

A dataset of 530652 observations on crime incidents between January 2003 and July 2017 is used. The sample also contained variables including type of crime, year, month, day, hour, and minute of when the reported crime activity happened, hundred block as generalized location of the report crime activity, neighbourhood where the crime occurred, x and y for coordinate values projected in UTM Zone 10, and latitude and longitude coordinate values. I found that the crime rate in Vancouver is decreasing and theft types of crimes play a major role in overall crime rate of the city. I also found that theft types of crimes make up a large proportion of total crime number among the top eight most dangerous neighbourhoods in Vancouver whereas break and enter crimes has a larger proportion of total crime incidents in other neighbourhoods.
